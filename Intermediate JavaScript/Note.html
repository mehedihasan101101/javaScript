   javaScript is a dynamic language. becase in javaScript we dont need to mention of the  name of a variable while declearing. JavaScript UNDERStand it automatically.
   primitive type data are those hold only a single value for example: let me = mehedi;
   Non-primitive type data are array, objects which holds a lot of values inside.non premitive types hold the referance.
   when value of a variable is not assigned will show undefined.
   when a function does not return anything will show undefined.
   if a search for a property that does not exist in an object will give undefined. same for an array.1
   closure is a combination of function binned together where the child functions have excess to variable inside the main function.
   A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later, usually after a specific operation is completed.
   array and object are pass by referance it means if we change the value of an array/object by function the value will be changed in the outer scope.but 
   for primitive variables it will not happen the value will not change in the outer scope.
