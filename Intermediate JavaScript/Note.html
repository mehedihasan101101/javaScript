   javaScript is a dynamic language. becase in javaScript we dont need to mention of the  name of a variable while declearing. JavaScript UNDERStand it automatically.
   primitive type data are those hold only a single value for example: let me = mehedi;
   Non-primitive type data are array, objects which holds a lot of values inside.non premitive types hold the referance.
   when value of a variable is not assigned will show undefined.
   when a function does not return anything will show undefined.
   if a search for a property that does not exist in an object will give undefined. same for an array.1
   closure is a combination of function binned together where the child functions have excess to variable inside the main function.
   A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later, usually after a specific operation is completed.
   array and object are pass by referance it means if we change the value of an array/object by function the value will be changed in the outer scope.but 
   for primitive variables it will not happen the value will not change in the outer scope.

<!-- NOTE FOR API -->
 API means "Application Programming Interface".
 JSON Mean JavaScript Object Notation
 rest api methods are "get,post,patch,delete"
 "Crud" means "Create,Read,Update,Delete"
 Error Codes are "404 Page Not found,202 means Ok,301 moved permanently,302 moved temporarily,500 internet server error,service unavailable."

<!-- JavaScript Theory -->
 javaScript is a  jit compiled multi-paradigm prototyped based dynamically typed language . JavaScript hide the impletion details show only the functionality of the users.
 users just need to give a high abstracted command.in javaScript the resource management and memory allocation do not needed to be handled.JavaScript collect garbages automatically
 such as it throws out elements without reference which has no needed.  JavaScript just in time(Jit) Compiled language. it read codes it compiled it, do processing optimization if needed and give the ultimate result. it
 do execute code  line by line like interpreted language. JavaScript is a multi paradigm language. it can be used as object orianted programming, functional programming.it is also a 
 dynamically typed  language means it read type automatically users do not need to mention type.

 javaScript use v8 engine to execute code 

 JavaScript Executing context is an Environment where javaScript Code is Executed. This Environment determine how the code is parsed,Stored in the memory and Run.

 There are two types of of JavaScript Executing Environment. 
   1/Global Execution Context. (GEC)
   2/Function Execution Context.(FEC)

 GEC is the first execution that JavaScript creates when a Script is run. Ges is represents the global Scope and consist of all globally declared variables,function.

 "A Function Execution Context (FEC) is created when a function is called. It has its own scope, separate from the Global Execution Context (GEC)." 

 JavaScript is a Single thread synchronous programming language which also support asynChronous programming.
 
 "Synchronous programming executes tasks (code) sequentially and blocks further execution until the previous task is completed."

 "Asynchronous programming allows code to execute without blocking the next task."

 "A JavaScript Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (fulfilled) or failure (rejected) of an asynchronous operation."

 Call stack is the data Structure that javaScript use to track all function calls. it use last in first out method. 

 JavaScript accomplishes its execution using a single-threaded, synchronous model. It handles asynchronous functions through the event loop.
 JavaScript sends tasks to the call stack for execution. The call stack processes tasks in order and delegates async tasks (like Promises, setTimeout, and fetch) to Web APIs.
 Once an async function is completed (resolved or rejected), the event loop moves it back to the call stack for executionâ€”but only when the call stack is empty.

 The .then() method is used with Promises in JavaScript. It allows us to handle the result of a Promise once it resolves successfully. 
 It takes a callback function that runs when the Promise is fulfilled."
 Both .then() and async/await are used for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, but they have key 
 differences in syntax, readability, and error handling.
